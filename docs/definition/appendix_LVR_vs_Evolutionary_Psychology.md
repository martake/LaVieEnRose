# Appendix: Differences Between La Vie En Rose (LVR) and Evolutionary Psychology

This document aims to provide an overview of the latest theories in **Evolutionary Psychology**
and to clarify the differences between those theories and the **La Vie En Rose (LVR)** model.

This paper is positioned as one of the supplementary documents of LVR.

## 1. Core Assumptions of Evolutionary Psychology (Current Understanding)

Evolutionary psychology is a field based on the following assumptions:

- Human psychological mechanisms are adaptations shaped through evolution (natural selection and sexual selection).
- The mind is not a blank slate but has innate design constraints.
- Many psychological functions are optimized for the **Environment of Evolutionary Adaptedness (EEA)** of the hunter-gatherer era.

Earlier strong claims of genetic determinism and strictly fixed modular views have now been substantially revised.

## 2. Updates in Contemporary Evolutionary Psychology

### 2.1 From Genetic Determinism to Interaction Models

The current mainstream view emphasizes interactive models such as:

- Genes × Development × Environment × Learning
- Psychological mechanisms are conditionally activated and branched

The idea that a single gene directly determines a single behavior is now largely rejected.

### 2.2 Emphasis on Development and Plasticity

- Early-life safety and environmental uncertainty influence the selection of:
  - Exploratory strategies
  - Stability-oriented strategies
- Psychological traits are not “hardwired” but are developmentally formed.

### 2.3 Integration with Cultural Evolution and Memes

- Culture is not merely an add-on.
- It is treated as a high-speed evolutionary process built on top of genetic evolution.
- However, the objective function is still placed on “fitness.”

### 2.4 Adaptation vs. Byproducts

- Not all psychological phenomena are adaptations.
- Religion, art, and abstract thinking are often explained as evolutionary byproducts.

## 3. Fundamental Differences Between LVR and Evolutionary Psychology

### 3.1 Difference in Objective Functions

| Perspective | Evolutionary Psychology | La Vie En Rose (LVR) |
|------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| Position | A discipline explaining human psychology based on general principles of biological evolution | A model primarily focused on world-recognition and meaning structures formed within human society |
| Scope | Humans and evolutionarily continuous life forms (comparative background) | Humans and human society |
| Ultimate Goal | Fitness (survival and reproduction) | Maintenance of meaning (expected to contribute indirectly to physical survival) |
| Happiness | A byproduct of adaptation | A key evaluation axis in meaning maintenance |
| Action Selection | Outcomes of genetic strategies | World-model updating processes |

In evolutionary psychology, “meaning” is explained as a result of adaptation.
In LVR, “meaning itself” is treated as the objective function.

### 3.2 Explicitness of the World Model

Evolutionary psychology:

- Discusses the existence of psychological mechanisms
- Leaves the form of internal representations (world models) implicit

LVR:

- Treats the world model not as a black box, but as an explicit object of analysis, including:
  - Structural equations
  - Projected outcomes
  - Update costs
- Focuses on distortions and breakdowns of world recognition as central phenomena

### 3.3 Differences in Time Scales

| Scale | Evolutionary Psychology | LVR |
|------|------------------------|-----|
| Tens of thousands of years | Primary | Background |
| Individual lifespan | Secondary | Primary |
| Moment-to-moment action | Limited | Central (reward density) |

Evolutionary psychology asks: “Why did this design emerge?”
LVR asks: “Why is this action chosen now?”

### 3.4 Treatment of Breakdown and Suffering

Evolutionary psychology:

- Explains maladaptation as environmental mismatch

LVR:

- World-model breakdown
- Collapse of meaning
- Inability to update as central themes

## 4. Positioning

Evolutionary psychology strongly explains the **Gene layer of LVR**,
but does not treat the Meme layer as an objective function.

In contemporary society, situations are observed in which fulfillment at the Meme layer
is evaluated more strongly than fulfillment at the Gene layer.

Therefore, LVR can be positioned as:

> A higher-level abstract model that incorporates evolutionary psychology,
> while primarily targeting meaning and world recognition
> at the scale of an individual lifespan.

## 5. Notes

This document aims at theoretical organization and does not deny evolutionary psychology.

Rather, LVR is an attempt to extend evolutionary psychology
by adopting it as a foundational premise.
