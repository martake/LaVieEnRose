# La Vie En Rose: Organization of the Purpose and Foundational Principles for Model Construction

La Vie En Rose is a decision-making model designed under the assumption that an individual's action choices are always subjectively rational.
Through this model, we aim to achieve a structural understanding of human action selection across the human lifespan.

## Modeling Assumptions

In modeling human action choices over a lifetime, La Vie En Rose adopts the following assumptions.

### Assumptions About the "Objective Function" of Action Selection – What Are Humans’ "Self‑Evident Desires"?

#### Human Desires – The Gene Layer and the Meme Layer

Human desires consist of two layers: the "maintenance of the body" and the "maintenance of meaning."

In this paper, "the body" refers to physical existence as a living organism.
This may include interpretations of humans as survival machines for selfish genes and their self-replication mechanisms.
However, because the concept of selfish genes itself is subject to debate, detailed discussion is avoided here.

By contrast, "meaning" refers to a subjective state in which one can predict and explain the relationship between one’s actions and their outcomes within the world in which one lives.
While it is fundamentally impossible for humans to fully and accurately understand the entirety of the world surrounding them,
a state in which one understands "why one is here now" and "what one should do next" serves as evidence that one’s past interpretations of the world were appropriate,
and increases the expectation that future choices can likewise be made appropriately.
In this paper, such a state—where the relationship between oneself and the world feels stable—is referred to as a state in which "meaning is maintained."

In terms of brain function, "maintenance of the body" primarily corresponds to the brainstem,
while "maintenance of meaning" primarily corresponds to the neocortex.

Hereafter, these are referred to respectively as desires of the Gene layer and desires of the Meme layer.

#### Grounds for the Existence of the Gene Layer and the Meme Layer

This paper does not address in detail the evolutionary origins of the Gene layer, but its existence is intuitively easy to understand.
It can also be explained statistically.
Acting with the goal of "maintaining the body" increases the probability of survival and reproduction.
Over more than 3.5 billion years since the emergence of life, and over 250,000 years since the emergence of modern humans,
it is strongly assumed that organisms possessing a Gene layer achieved superior survival and reproductive outcomes compared to those that did not.
Thus, assuming that present-day humans retain Gene-layer desires is by no means an unreasonable leap.

The existence of the Meme layer is also intuitively understandable.
It can likewise be explained to some extent from a statistical perspective.
Maintaining a state in which "the interpretation of the world is appropriate and the future is predictable" is expected to increase the stability of "maintenance of the body."
In other words, the Meme layer is presumed to have emerged and developed as one strategy to support the fulfillment of Gene-layer desires.
Although the detailed evolutionary process lies beyond the scope of this paper,
it cannot be denied that organisms with superior Meme layers were advantaged in survival and reproduction.

#### Which Desire Fulfillment Constitutes the "Human Objective"?

From the perspective of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs,
fulfillment of Gene-layer desires takes priority, followed by pursuit of Meme-layer desire fulfillment.

If humans are viewed purely as biological organisms,
Meme-layer desire fulfillment has no meaning beyond that of an intermediate variable supporting the Gene layer.

However, with the increase in human population, the formation of communities, and the growing complexity of social structures,
constructing an appropriate model of the world has come to require many more elements,
and the Meme layer has expanded dramatically relative to the Gene layer.

As a result of this expansion, Meme-layer desire fulfillment has in some cases exceeded its original role as an intermediate variable
and has come to function as a pseudo objective function.

Examples include action choices such as "abandonment of the body" due to "loss of meaning,"
or "sacrifice of the body" for the purpose of "acquiring meaning."

When examining typical patterns of human action selection in modern society,
it is more appropriate to treat the Gene layer as a given constraint
and to discuss the Meme layer as the primary target of optimization.

Accordingly, in designing this model,
we adopt the position that **for humans, "maintenance of meaning" is a naturally occurring and self-evident desire equal to or even exceeding "maintenance of the body."**

### Definition of the "World" – The "True World" and the Individual’s "World"

Humans exist within an existential space.
Within this space exist third-person, objectively measurable "countable facts," which are referred to here as the "true world."

However, attempting to reproduce a universal "true world" shared by all humanity is of little significance when discussing human action selection.

While the "true world" encompasses at least the entirety of the living sphere of modern humanity,
the range that an individual can observe, traverse, and choose within is limited,
and only a portion of the "true world" directly affects any given individual.

Furthermore, an individual’s observed "world" always involves interpretation of the "true world."
A mountain that person A can climb cannot be climbed by person B.
A sea that person B can cross cannot be crossed by person C.
Judgments regarding "whether an action is possible and at what cost" are strongly influenced by existential constraints
that are difficult to adjust by individual will alone.
These constraints differ among individuals and include, for example,
genetic talents, physical abilities, physical condition, region of upbringing, and remaining lifespan.
This is referred to as the "personal existential world."

The "world" addressed by this model is not a reproduction or approximation of the "true world,"
but rather the "personal existential world" constructed through existential constraints.

### Definition of the "Recognized World" – The Individual’s "Personal Existential World" and "Personal Recognized World"

In the previous section, we assumed that the world surrounding humans is not the "true world" but the "personal existential world."
However, the "world recognition" used by individuals when making action choices is not identical to the "personal existential world" either.

If one could accurately understand the "personal existential world," maximizing payoff would be straightforward.
However, the "personal existential world" changes under the influence of the "true world."
Therefore, it is difficult for individuals to fully grasp its overall structure.

It is assumed that individuals possess a "personal recognized world"—a subjective approximation of the "personal existential world"—
and that they make action choices based on this recognized world.

## Summary of Assumptions – The Fundamental Stance of Model Construction

- The essential payoff in life should be the Gene-layer desire of "maintenance of the body"
- However, assuming that the primary objective function of individuals in modern human society is not "maximization of payoff" but rather the Meme-layer desire of "maintenance of meaning" better reflects reality
- Therefore, when assuming that humans always act in a "subjectively rational" manner, such rational action means "optimization of the objective function" to the same extent as, or more than, "maximization of payoff"
- The "world" in which humans live consists of a "true world" described by countable facts, an individual "personal world" shaped by existential constraints, and a "personal recognized world" representing the individual’s interpretation of that personal existential world.
  This model addresses the "personal existential world" and the "personal recognized world"
